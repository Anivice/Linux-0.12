# Linux 0.12 meets modern build system

This is a highly modified Linux system (v0.12) used for 
educational purpose only. Currently, it supports both
"Unix Makefiles" and "Ninja". Other build system are not 
tested, but first it's worthless doing that since 
these two build system already covers the majority of
the users, also I don't think it ever ganna work on Windows
